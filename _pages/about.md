I am a recent Bachelor of Science graduate in Software Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Bangladesh, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research focuses on enhancing the security, privacy, and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure that AI-driven applications are trustworthy, adversarially resilient, and ethically sound.

Currently, I am exploring security vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), including adversarial robustness, prompt injection defenses, and privacy-preserving fine-tuning strategies. Additionally, I am interested in the secure integration of AI into software engineering workflows, ensuring robust, reliable, and adversarially resilient AI-driven applications.

# Research Interest

### Adversarial Attacks & Robustness
- Investigating attack vectors such as prompt injection, jailbreak attacks, and backdoor vulnerabilities in instruction-tuned models.
- Developing adversarial training techniques and robust fine-tuning strategies to mitigate such attacks.

### Privacy & Data Protection in LLMs
- Addressing challenges in training LLMs while preserving user privacy, including differentially private fine-tuning and federated learning techniques.
- Preventing unintended memorization of sensitive data in generative models.

### Trustworthy AI & Ethical Safeguards
- Developing mechanisms for explainability and trust in AI-generated outputs, ensuring fairness in LLM responses.
- Bias mitigation strategies to prevent security loopholes stemming from biased training data and model behaviors.

### Secure AI Software Engineering
- Integrating AI into software development pipelines while ensuring security best practices, including secure coding, model interpretability, and adversarial resilience.
- Investigating supply chain security risks in AI-driven applications, ensuring safe deployment of LLMs in production environments.
- Leveraging AI for automated vulnerability detection and secure software development lifecycles (SDLC).

### Efficient & Secure Deployment
- Optimizing LLM inference for secure edge AI applications with minimal security risks.
- Investigating methods for secure model compression and encrypted inference to prevent model theft and unauthorized access.
