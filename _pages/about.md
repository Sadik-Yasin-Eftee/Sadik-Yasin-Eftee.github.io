I am a recent Bachelor of Science graduate in Software Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Bangladesh, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research focuses on enhancing the security, privacy, and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure that AI-driven applications are trustworthy, adversarially resilient, and ethically sound.

Currently, I am exploring security vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), including adversarial robustness, prompt injection defenses, and privacy-preserving fine-tuning strategies. Additionally, I am interested in the secure integration of AI into software engineering workflows, ensuring robust, reliable, and adversarially resilient AI-driven applications.

# Research Interest

- **Adversarial Attacks & Robustness**
  - Investigating attack vectors like prompt injection, jailbreak attacks, and backdoor vulnerabilities in instruction-tuned models; developing adversarial training techniques and robust fine-tuning strategies.

- **Privacy & Data Protection in LLMs**
  - Addressing challenges in training LLMs while preserving user privacy through differentially private fine-tuning and federated learning; preventing unintended memorization of sensitive data.

- **Trustworthy AI & Ethical Safeguards**
  - Developing mechanisms for explainability and trust in AI-generated outputs, ensuring fairness, and applying bias mitigation strategies to avoid security loopholes.

- **Secure AI Software Engineering**
  - Integrating AI into development pipelines with secure coding, model interpretability, and adversarial resilience; investigating supply chain security risks and automating vulnerability detection in SDLC.

- **Efficient & Secure Deployment**
  - Optimizing LLM inference for secure edge AI applications and exploring secure model compression and encrypted inference to prevent model theft and unauthorized access.
